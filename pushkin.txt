Should this life sometime deceive you…

Alexandr Pushkin

Should this life sometime deceive you,
Don’t be sad or mad at it!
On a gloomy day, submit:
Trust – fair day will come, why grieve you?
Heart lives in the future, so
What if gloom pervade the present?
All is fleeting, all will go;
What is gone will then be pleasant.
