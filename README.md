### (c++) getline

[getline()](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/getline/)
(1)	
istream& getline (istream&  is, string& str, char delim);
istream& getline (istream&& is, string& str, char delim);
(2)	
istream& getline (istream&  is, string& str);
istream& getline (istream&& is, string& str);

Extracts characters from is and stores them into str until the delimitation character delim is found (or the newline character, '\n', for (2)).
